bhs-javascript
==============

This is a set of basic code files for use by the students of the Bremerton High School JavaScript class.

The class is using Cloud9 as an IDE (https://c9.io). In order to get this code into a new workspace, do the following:

1. Log in to Cloud9 and "Go to your Dashboard" (at top right).
2. Once the dashboard is loaded, there will be a green button that says "CREATE NEW WORKSPACE" (near top left).
3. Click the new workspace button, and select "Clone From URL".
4. In the popup window, paste the URL for this repo into the box (https://github.com/atsid/bhs-javascript)
5. Click "CREATE" at bottom right of the popup, and it will take you back to the dashboard where the workspace is importing.
6. Select the workspace from the list of workspaces in the left panel, and click the "START EDITING" button to the right.

Once the workspace is open, you can navigate the files just like on your computer, by opening and closing the folders and double-clicking the files.

To view an HTML file, open it in the editor, and click the "Preview" button along the top. It will open in a panel to the right, which you can reload periodically to see your code how it would look on the Internet.

For getting the most recent lesson you can use the git command on the terminal.

1. View -> Terminals -> New Terminal
2. Once the terminal loads and give you a command prompt enter the following commands.
3. git reset --hard <enter>
4. The workspace will not be back to the way it was prior to any changes that have been made
4. git pull <enter>
5. This will get the new changes from the git repo.
